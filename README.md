Directions:
To get this running, just pull from git and open that folder as a project in netbeans.
At first, it wont run. You have to create a class called "APIKey" with one method "public String getAPIKey()". 

Make sure you .git ignore the file!

Have that method return the api key (get it from Jack).

Example:

public class APIKey {
    
    public String getAPIKey(){
    
        //place api key here
        return "MY_API_KEY";
    }
}
